# Kanbanator
Hunt down your to-do's like the Terminator... let none of'em alive!

## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**
**Overview**

With Kanbanator, you'll experience the power of the Kanban method, revolutionizing the way you manage tasks and projects. No more juggling multiple spreadsheets or sticky notes â€“ our intuitive interface makes task organization a breeze.

Kanbanator provides users with a visual Kanban board interface, consisting of columns representing different stages of a workflow (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done). Users can create, organize, and prioritize tasks by dragging and dropping them across the board.

The site is intuitive and easy to use.

Remember to check out a cool feature that lights the Kanbanator's eye on the main title when you hover.

Also on the logo!

Adding a new task is a straightforward process; just click on `New task`.

However, it's crucial to fill out the form correctly by adding a `Title`, `Description`, and `Date` of the task. Failure to do so will prevent you from continuing. Once you've completed the form, hit `Add Task`, and your new task will appear in the to-do column.

You can add as many as you like. Each task will be colored according to its due date: red for urgent, yellow for close, and white for safe.

Move the tasks as you wish, depending on their status. Done tasks will get green!

Last but not least, you can remove any task, maybe because it's TERMINATED!
